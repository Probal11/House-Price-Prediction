## 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using the **[House Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhamedumarjamil/house-price-prediction-dataset)** from Kaggle.
It focuses on building a **Linear Regression model** to estimate property prices based on key housing features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking availability.

### 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to apply a simple yet powerful regression algorithm — **Linear Regression** — to understand how various features influence house prices.
The model was trained and evaluated using **Scikit-learn**, with data preprocessing and analysis handled through **Pandas**.

### 🧠 Key Steps

* Data loading and cleaning using Pandas
* Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
* Training a Linear Regression model
* Evaluating performance using **R² score**

### 🧰 Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook

### 📊 Results

The Linear Regression model provided a basic understanding of feature-price relationships and served as a foundation for exploring more advanced predictive models in the future.
